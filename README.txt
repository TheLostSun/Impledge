To run the file , simply run the Main.java file in the /src folder. 
The src folder MUST include the text files containing the words that need to be checked. 
This code assumes that the text filename is to be inputted by the user (filename should include the .txt extension). 
In case the file is not found , an exception message of "File Not Found" is thrown.
